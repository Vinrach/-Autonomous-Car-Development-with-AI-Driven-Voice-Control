# Autonomous-Car-Development-with-AI-Driven-Voice-Control
# Abstract
This project represents the design and implementation of a Voice controlled car with obstacle 
detection and measurement to engage surveillance in co-ordination with a human operator. An 
unmanned ground vehicle is operated without an on-board human presence, while in contact with the 
ground. The vehicle in this project is based on a four-wheel chassis. The vehicles motion is being 
controlled through a Bluetooth module which receives navigation commands from an android device. 
That received commands from Bluetooth module are sent to the Arduino Uno R3 board which 
process the code and moves the motors accordingly with the help of motor shield. An ultrasonic 
sensor is being integrated in the vehicle to detect the obstacle and a 16*2 LCD display is used to 
display the distance between obstacle and the vehicle. It is constructed to operate on an 12v LiPo 
battery
